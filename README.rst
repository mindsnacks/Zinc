Zinc
====

Zinc is asset distribution system for designed mobile apps. Common use cases
are for downloading content purchased through an in-app-purchase mechanism, or 
to avoid packaging large files inside your app package if they may not be
needed.

The central concept in Zinc is a "bundle", which is just a group of assets. For
example, a bundle could be a level for a game, which includes spritesheets,
background music, and metadata.

Zinc bundles are also versioned, which means they can be updated. For example,
if you wanted to change the background music in a game, you can do that by
pushing a new version of that bundle.

Finally, Zinc also has a notion of "distributions" for a bundles, which are
basically just tags. This allows clients to track a tag such as `master`
instead of the version directly. Then whenever the `master` distribution is
updated, clients will automatically download the changes.

Feature Highlights
------------------

- Files are tracked by content. If the same file exists in multiple bundles or versions, it is only stored once.  
- "CDN Compatible" meaning that a Zinc catalog can be hosted on a dumb file server.

Status
------

Zinc is in the early development stage should be consider 'alpha' at
best.
